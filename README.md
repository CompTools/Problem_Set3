# Problem_Set3

## Problem 1
This code opens the appropriate file and reports the highest water level and its associated data using a 'for' loop.

## Problem 2
This code reads the file into a Pandas dataframe and reports the highest water level and its assoiated data.

## Problem 3
This code calculates the fastest rise in water level per 6-minute period between measurements and reports the fastest rise. This code 
also creates an additional column 'deltaWaterLevel' that captures the difference between water level measurments per row. 
This new column is that used to observe the fastest rise in water level.

## Problem 4
This code plots a line graph of water level over time using matplotlib.

## Extra Credit
This code downloads water level data from Panama City, Fl for any day entered.
This code does not work and I was not able to find and correct the issue
